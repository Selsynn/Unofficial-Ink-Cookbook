# Chapter 1: Interactive Fiction and Narrative Games

**Summary**: In this chapter, you will learn about the connection between interactive fiction and choose-you-own-adventure books, how nonlinear stories work, and the rise of the term of "narrative games" to describe projects that are similar to text-only games but have more graphical elements.

## Introduction to Interactive Fiction

Much of what we have come to know as "video games" today had its roots in a genre now called *text-parsers*. Playing these games consisted of entering and reading text. The player would enter a command, and the game would respond to them.

The first of what would become this genre was *Colossal Cave* (1977), a game about, as it name implies, exploring a large cave system. It was the first to use different directions for movement and to feature an inventory. The game most people think of when they consider this time in video games, however, is *Zork I* (1983), which was heavily inspired by *Colossal Cave* (1977) and classically used the most famous command of these types of games:

```
>get lamp
```

### Interactive Fiction

The term *interactive fiction* is often used to describe games like these because of their textual nature. Playing them was like reading a story where the reader (player) could direct the story along different paths. They could take a moment to explore an area, read more about something, or merely move around in the game.

All of the instructions to the game were also typed. When a player interacted with the fiction, they were reading and writing parts at the same time. They could take different actions and the game would respond accordingly based on how it was programmed.

## Choose Your Own Adventure!

Around the same time as *Colossal Cave* (1977), the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure (CYOA) series of books first started coming out. These books were not written to be read linear, page-by-page manner. Every few pages, the reader had to make a decision and then turn to a different page in the book where the story picked back up. Depending on the decisions made by the reader, they might even end up with an ending! 

Through working through the story, the reader was making choices of where they wanted to go next. While not always thought of in this sense, they were "interactive" fiction as well. They presented a way for a reader decide what to do next and the story supported those choices! The player had to turn pages and make decisions.

## Nonlinear Storytelling

As a more general term, nonlinear storytelling consists of these two different aspects: making decisions and reacting to the consequences. Both *Colossal Cave* (1977) and the CYOA series of books are examples of how different mediums present these two aspects. When a reader or player interacts with the product, they are presented with choices. Choosing one sends them down one path or another in a story. Making choices and seeing different parts of the story are what make them nonlinear. Unlike other books, reading straight through a CYOA book would be no fun! Neither would seeing all the text of a game like *Colossal Cave* (1977) without also being about to play it through giving it commands of what to do next as well.

## Narrative Games

Early computers worked through users typing commands. They would type something, the computer would try to understand it, and then it would respond in some way. Many of the games created in the 1980s up through the 1990s followed this same model: they used typing commands as the many source of player input in order to navigate digital worlds. Players would "play" through using a keyboard and typing out what they wanted to happen next.

As computer graphics improved, many games began to take the same nonlinear storytelling aspects of the earlier games and apply them in new ways. Decades after *Colossal Cave* (1977), large online games were possible through a number of different advances in graphical and communication technologies. Yet, at their root, many video games still have a heavier reliance on reading text and making choices, the central part of all nonlinear storytelling.

To help label games that may be more textual in nature, many people have used the term *narrative games*. These often refer to games that have deeper stories, ask players to read and understand aspects of the world in order to better engage with them, and then ask players to make choices based on what they have learned. They share in the same lineage of *Zork I* (1980), but use advanced graphics, online functionality, or even multiplayer systems to convey their messages. 

## Adventure Games

With improvements to graphical technologies, videos game moved away from strictly text input and started to use more interactive forms. Players were given the ability to click on different elements and work with graphical interfaces. More narrative-based games moved from text-parsers to what became *adventure games*. These began by combining text commands with graphical elements such as backgrounds and characters, but quickly became a way of describing games that were more click-based. The player would click on something on screen and the player would see short descriptions or ways to interact with on-screen elements.

Adventure games borrowed from works like the earlier CYOA books, but used different interfaces. Famous games from this genre and period include the *The Secret of Monkey Island* (1990) and *Myst* (1993).

## Hypertext

The rise of the world wide web starting in 1994 changed how people accessed information and thought about interfaces. While some users had come to use graphical user interfaces in games, the mouse quickly became the focus as some early games used *hypertext*, documents designed for reading by a web browser, as the medium of the game itself. In these,
