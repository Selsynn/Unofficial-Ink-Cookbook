## Style Conventions

This book uses some style conventions to visually explain concepts.

### Code

All Ink code is marked in code blocks. It may appear `in-line`, but most code will appear as the following:

```ink
This is some code.
This is a second line of code.
```

### Emphasis

#### Concepts

When introducing terms, it will be given *emphasis*.

In different places, *emphasis may repeated to stress importance or connection to other, previous concepts.*

#### Representations

Strong emphasis is used for **story knots** and **stitches**. As these are the different sections of a story, they are given **strong emphasis**

Diverts are represented as in-line code blocks. For example, the divert `-> Example` would be shown with both its arrow and the name of the knots or stitch it uses.

Keywords in Ink also appear throughout using in-line code blocks. For example, `VAR` would appear like this.

Choices are written using *emphasis*. However, their output is enclosed in quotation marks.

## Other Programming Languages

When discussing other scripting or programming languages such as JavaScript or C#, *emphasis* is used for properties. Strong emphasis is used for the name of objects, methods, or other complex data structures.

## Notes and Reminders

Notes appear as blockquotes:

> **Note:** Notes appear in blockquotes throughout the book to clarify or explain certain concepts.

Reminders also appear as blockquotes:

> **Reminder:** Some chapters have reminders on previous topics and concepts covered in the book.
