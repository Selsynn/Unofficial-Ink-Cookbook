## Who This Book is For

## Style Conventions

This book uses some style conventions to visually explain concepts.

### Code

All Ink code is marked in code-blocks. It may appear `in-line`, but most code will appear as the following:

```ink
This is some code.
This is a second line of code.
```

### Emphasis

When introducing terms, it will be given *emphasis*.

In different places, *emphasis may be used to stress its importance or connection to other concepts.*

In rare cases, strong emphasis is used to **stress warnings or potential problems.**.
