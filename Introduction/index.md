## Style Conventions

This book uses some style conventions to visually explain concepts.

### Code

All Ink code is marked in code blocks. It may appear `in-line`, but most code will appear as the following:

```ink
This is some code.
This is a second line of code.
```

### Emphasis

When introducing terms, it will be given *emphasis*.

In different places, *emphasis may be used to stress its importance or connection to other concepts.*

In rare cases, strong emphasis is used to **stress warnings or potential problems.**.

### Code Styling

Keywords in Ink appear through in-line code blocks. For example, `VAR` would appear like this.

When discussing other scripting or programming languages, emphasis is used for properties and function names. Strong emphasis is used for the name of objects or other complex data structures.
