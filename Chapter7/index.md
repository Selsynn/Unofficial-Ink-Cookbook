**Summary:** In this chapter, you will learn about *Gather Points*, how they are used, and the shorthand they provide for larger and more complex projects.

## Gather Points

Ink uses the concept of the Weave to understand choices and their connection to each other. Gather Points act as a way to see the relationship between Knots and the Diverts that connect them together.

Ink uses the concept of Flow to describe how a story moves through different options and across branching paths. Within a Flow, Ink also uses the idea of a Weave, a section of options and gather points that connect to each other, to serve as a faster shorthand than using knots and diverts.

Gather Points use the minus sign, `-`, and serve as their name suggests, they gather. They act as the thing to run after a set of choices to "gather" their weave back together. Instead of using knots and diverts to show short text strings by bouncing between them, gather points can quickly fold back into each other.

## Labelled Options

Like knots, options can also be labelled. Like what was done with conditional choices, labelled options can work the same way. Code can check to see if an option has been chosen and react accordingly.

While knots and stitches can be used to divert into new story sections, using a weave, with gather points and labelled options, code can be reduced in complexity.
